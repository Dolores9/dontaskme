## Welcome to Don't Ask Me AI!

Don't Ask Me AI is an educational mobile application built with React Native and Expo, powered by a robust Azure OpenAI backend. 

This isn’t just another AI that spits out answers. Instead, this AI acts like a supportive, always-available tutor — a digital teacher that guides rather than gives. It helps students explore the path to answers by asking the right questions, providing structure, and encouraging behaviour.

The goal? To teach students how to learn, not just what the answer is.
The virtual coach will:

- [Help] Help students break down assignments into manageable tasks.

- [Offer] Offers guidance for the student when the teacher isn’t around, instead of giving answers. 

## What makes my AI different?

Most AI study tools focus on giving quick answers, writing full essays, or summarizing large texts. While that might seem helpful at first, it can actually make students more passive and dependent.

It’s not about doing the work for students — it’s about helping them develop the skills and habits they need to succeed on their own.
